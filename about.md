<h1>About me.</h1>

<p>Hi! I'm Alex, welcome to my blog. I am an all around problem solver, and I love exploring all the ways learning and automation can be engineered to add business value. I'm interested in machine learning, robotics, programming language design, electronics, 3D printing, IoT devices and drones. I love to chat about practical challenges and opportunities within applied Machine Learning systems, continuous operations (MLOps) and the latest scientific developments.</p>

        <p>I started this blog for two purposes: to write about what I'm learning in my own words, and to share my perspectives and reflections with others and my future self. The former reason serves mainly to reinforce what I'm learning (you don't really know something unless you can teach it!), while the latter is simply a way for me to share what reflections I've found helpful for me and store a snapshot of my views over the course of my life. Many of the blog posts are a living document, so I'll come back and edit things, add new info, etc. These are also pretty informal posts, more of a quick brain dump than a work of literary art.</p>

In all honesty, this is more of a journal than a blog, but I've chosen to make this journal public in the case of a) the content can help someone else and b) someone disagrees and we can have a discussion. I'm a big believer in open, frank critique of ideas and I believe the best way to grow an idea is to attack it. Don't take what I write on here for granted - ask yourself if what I'm talking about makes sense to you. If it doesn't, speak up! Let's have a discussion.

<p>I'm super excited to share what I'm learning on this blog.</p>
<p>Feel free to be in touch! Thanks for stopping by.</p>

<h2>A little bit about myself</h2>


<div class="side-by-side">
    <div class="toleft">
    <p>I love running in the wild, and I'm always running with my dog and my wife on coastal trails, in the bush and in very muddy obstacle races. I also have a kitesurfing gear that I'll take out when the winds are strong enough for sailing.
		Another curiosity about me is that I used to be more of an adrenaline seeker when younger. I've competed on big motocross championships, jiu-jitsu tournments, and I also have done a lot of abseiling out of very tall buildings. I'm really grateful for having had these opportunities growing up because these environments taught me how to read the context, plan, focus and quickly adapt to achieve goals and take the right actions.</p>
